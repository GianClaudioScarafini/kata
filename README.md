# This is my personal journey into the world of algorithms.
I am using CodeWars to practice consistently and challenge myself with real problems. The goal is simple — exercise my brain, get comfortable with new challenges, and build the problem-solving skills needed for technical interviews.

## 📌 About My Process

My approach to every kata:

1. **Read** — understand the problem before writing a single line
2. **Pseudocode** — plan the logic in plain english first
3. **Code** — write a working solution
4. **Refactor** — clean it up, make it readable

For each kata I also document:
- What I found complex or confusing
- The link to the original kata on CodeWars
- Mistakes I made along the way

> 💡 *Note: sometimes the kata instructions are not fully clear. You will see cases where I solved the wrong problem at first — I document those too, because that's part of the learning.*
